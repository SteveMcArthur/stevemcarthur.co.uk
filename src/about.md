I started my professional life as a cartographer in the glory days of the Australian oil and gas industry. Cartography is a curious blend of technical and design skills. And increasingly I found myself programming repetitive tasks and displaying the results on web pages. As time went on I was creating full blown web applications and web sites. It soon became clear that this was what I enjoyed.

Moving to the UK I became a full time website and database developer. I created many interactive applications and complementary webservices. The design side of the cartographer also began to kick in and I became more and more interested in the design side of website creation.

These days I build websites for both pleasure and work. I'm lucky that I have all the back-end skills as well as front-end skills that you need to create any sort of site from start to finish.
